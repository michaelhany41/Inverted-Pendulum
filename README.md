# Inverted-Pendulum_STM
This project involves the development of an inverted pendulum system controlled by an STM32 microcontroller, with feedback provided by a linear angular position sensor. The primary objective is to achieve real-time stabilization of the pendulum in its upright position through precise measurement and control of its angular displacement. The system serves as a practical demonstration of control theory principles, particularly in the implementation of feedback loops and PID control strategies.

The inverted pendulum is a classical problem in dynamics and control systems, representing a system that is inherently unstable without continuous corrective input. In this project, the pendulum is mounted on a motorized base, and its angular position relative to the vertical axis is measured using a high-resolution angular position sensor, such as a gyroscope or an inertial measurement unit (IMU). This sensor provides real-time feedback on the tilt angle of the pendulum, which is critical for calculating the necessary control actions.

At the core of the system is an STM32 microcontroller, which is responsible for reading sensor data, computing the control output using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) algorithm, and driving the motors accordingly. The microcontroller receives continuous input from the angular sensor, analyzes the tilt angle and angular velocity, and determines the direction and magnitude of motor rotation needed to restore balance. The motor then moves the base of the pendulum forward or backward to counteract any deviation from the upright position.

The hardware setup consists of the STM32 board, the angular position sensor, motor drivers, and DC motors mounted on a movable base. The mechanical structure is designed to allow smooth and responsive motion, ensuring the control algorithm can stabilize the pendulum effectively. Power is supplied through a regulated power source to ensure consistent operation of all electronic components.

To operate the system, the user must first flash the control firmware to the STM32 using a supported development environment such as STM32CubeIDE. Once powered, the system initializes the sensor, calibrates the angle readings, and begins the balancing routine. The performance of the system can be fine-tuned by adjusting the PID gains to match the physical parameters of the pendulum and the responsiveness of the motors.

This inverted pendulum project not only demonstrates the capabilities of STM32 microcontrollers in real-time embedded control applications but also provides a hands-on platform for exploring advanced control techniques. It serves as a foundational experiment in both academic and hobbyist contexts, illustrating how sensor data, mathematical models, and embedded systems can be integrated to solve complex dynamic problems.
